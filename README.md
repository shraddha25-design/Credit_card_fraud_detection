# Credit_card_fraud_detection
The aim of this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.

As the online systems have gained a boom, the risks of frauds have also increased. Most people are not aware of what details to share when they recieve such fraudulent calls and end up being a victim. The details that you might share with them could grant them unhindered access to your credit card account.
 
These frauds affect banks' business and banks need to be cautious about their customers’ transactions, as they cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters. Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions if it is reported within a certain time frame by the customer.
